## Introduction

This project is a recreation of the classic Snake Game. The player controls a snake that moves around the game board, eating apples to grow longer. The game ends when the snake collides with itself or the boundaries of the game board.

## Features

- Snake movement in all four directions (up, down, left, right)
- Apple spawning at random positions on the game board
- Snake grows longer when it eats an apple
- Collision detection to end the game if the snake collides with itself or the boundaries
- Score tracking based on the length of the snake and the number of apples eaten
- Game over message with the final score
- Restart functionality to play again after the game ends

## How to Play
